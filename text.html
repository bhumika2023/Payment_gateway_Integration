        <h1>"Giving is not just about making a donation,its about making a difference"</h1>
        <p>Not all of us can do great things.But we can do small things with great love.
          1 in 11 children go to work when they should be in school. When it is hard to afford necessities like food, shelter, and clothing; education becomes a luxury that the poor give up. Illiteracy then leads to further poverty. Donate for child education in India, support them with fees, school supplies, footwear, transport and opportunities to showcase their talents.
          A little help of yours can prevent the situation getting more worse for them.
          Even a small donation would help us a lot.
          To help the poor to raise their head and face the future with
          pride and hope with The Sparks Foundation.
